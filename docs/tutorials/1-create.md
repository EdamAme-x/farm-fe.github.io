# 1. Create A Project
In this chapter, we will create a new Farm React project from scratch, and launch it in development mode.

:::note
In this tutorial, we use `pnpm` as default package manager.
:::

## Create a package
First we execute `pnpm init` to create a new package.

```bash
mkdir farm-react && cd farm-react && pnpm init
```

A `package.json` file will be autogenerated.

## Install Dependencies
Install necessary dependencies:

react and react-dom:
```bash
pnpm add react react-dom
```

farm related dependencies:
```bash
pnpm add -D @farmfe/cli @farmfe/core @farmfe/plugin-react
```
There are 3 packages that are necessary for a react project:
* **`@farmfe/cli`**: This package provides commands like `farm start`, `farm build`, `farm preview`, it must be used with `@farmfe/core` and can not be used separately.
* **`@farmfe/core`**: This package provides `Compilation` and `Dev Server` abilities, provides all necessary component for local development and product build. It exports `Compiler`, `DevServer` and `Watcher`, which is used for `compile the project`, `serve the project in development mode` and `watch the project for Hot Module Replacement`.
* **`@farmfe/plugin-react`**: This package provides abilities for React Jsx compilation, and react-refresh support.
